Muhha! Standardized Core Shading Language
The Muhha! Virtual GPU Chipset Series
The Muhha! Virtual GPU series is built upon VHDL principles and is compared to OpenGL Shading Language. It consists of a C# and Javascript based language which compiles the six supervisor level virtual appliances. 

#####Muhha! Shader Bytecode Language Specification
Shader based byte level instruction language rulesets
#####Muhha! Shader Reference Appliance Specification
Nested algebraic GPU output data rulesets
#####Muhha! Shader Architecture Appliance Specification
Super entity template generator and GPU refactoring rulesets
#####Muhha! Shader Native Core Appliance Specification
Base virtual GPU chip operating ruleset
#####Muhha! Shader Developer Appliance Specification
Semicom developer certification ruleset
#####Muhha! Shader Optimization Appliance Specification
New shader component evalution and diagnostics for shader set, extension, license, plugin, appliance, template and  system import/export rulesets
#####Muhha! Shader Network Appliance Specification

###Description of Features:
Complete compliant graphic testing and package new graphic SoC projects for deployment. Render waveform diagnostics with real-time editing.

Import/Export GPU libraries to add extensibility and advanced graphic output.
Install extensions into the appliances and create re-distributable virtual components.
Generate graphic instruction sets to execute simple and advanced processing routines for multi-platform graphics.
Debug projects and maintain project management using ASIC specific virtual  supervisors. 
Edit with customizable calltips and syntax suggestion that automate codesmith tasks.
Print in UML, XML, CAD, 3D/obj and other extensions.

The ''[[Labcoat-Cleanroom]]'' is a component of Labcoat which maintains what are known 'presets', function-based content which enhance or define chipset performance. Below is a list of supported presets:

#####Substrate Presets- The components used to outline wafers
#####Techtree Presets- The indexing components of the chipset. Outlines circuit paths
#####Architecture Presets- The chipset model cache form factor
#####Processor Presets- The command center of the chipset
#####Lexicon Presets- The onboard logarithm database
#####Entity Presets- The developer profile manager
#####Schematic Presets- The mapping and data flow debugger
